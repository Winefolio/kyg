## Design Principles

1. **Mobile-first** - Most wine moments happen on phones (store, restaurant, home)
2. **Actionable** - Every screen should answer "what should I do next?"
3. **Personal** - Feel like the app knows you, not generic wine content
4. **Celebratory** - Make progress feel good with animations and acknowledgment
5. **Simple** - Wine is intimidating enough; the app should reduce complexity
