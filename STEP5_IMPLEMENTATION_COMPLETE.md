# Step 5 Implementation - Complete Wine Flow

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete Step 5 wine completion flow with all 6 sub-steps.

## Implementation Details

### Step 5.1: Wine Completion Detection
- ✅ `checkWineCompletion()` function detects when all questions for a wine are answered
- ✅ Tracks completion status in `currentWineCompletionStatus` state
- ✅ Extensive debugging logging for troubleshooting

### Step 5.2: Blocking Timer UI
- ✅ Full-screen blocking overlay appears when wine is complete
- ✅ 2-minute countdown timer with proper formatting (`mm:ss`)
- ✅ Prevents navigation until timer expires or user skips
- ✅ Elegant UI with wine completion celebration

### Step 5.3: Skip Option
- ✅ "Skip Wait & Continue" button allows immediate progression
- ✅ Timer can be bypassed by user action
- ✅ Maintains user control over timing

### Step 5.4: Navigation Blocking
- ✅ `goToNextSlide()` function checks `isBlocking` state
- ✅ Navigation completely blocked during timer phase
- ✅ Console logging shows blocking status for debugging

### Step 5.5: Processing Integration
- ✅ Automatically triggers Step 3 (sentiment analysis) when timer expires/skipped
- ✅ Automatically triggers Step 4 (calculate averages) after sentiment analysis
- ✅ Prevents double-processing with `hasTriggeredProcessing` flag

### Step 5.6: Slide Progression ⭐ NEW
- ✅ Shows group averages after processing completes
- ✅ Beautiful averages display overlay with all question scores
- ✅ 5-second auto-progression to next wine
- ✅ Manual "Continue to Next Wine" button option
- ✅ Proper wine transition and introduction flow
- ✅ Complete state cleanup for next wine

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [currentWineCompletionStatus, setCurrentWineCompletionStatus] = useState<{
  wineId: string | null;
  isParticipantFinished: boolean;
  showingCompletionStatus: boolean;
  hasTriggeredProcessing: boolean;
  isBlocking: boolean;
  showingAverages: boolean; // NEW
  averagesData: any; // NEW
}>
```

### Key Functions Added
- `handleAveragesComplete()` - Handles progression after averages shown
- Enhanced `averageCalculationMutation` - Triggers averages display
- Complete state management for averages flow

### UI Components
1. **Blocking Timer Overlay** - Full-screen wine completion celebration
2. **Averages Display Overlay** - Shows group results with styling
3. **WineCompletionStatus** - Non-blocking banner component

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start a tasting session** with multiple wines
2. **Answer all questions** for the first wine
3. **Try to navigate** → Should see blocking timer overlay
4. **Wait or skip** → Should trigger processing
5. **See averages display** → Shows group results for ~5 seconds  
6. **Auto-progression** → Moves to next wine with proper transitions

## Debug Console Output
Look for these console messages during testing:
- `🍷 Wine completion check:` - Wine completion detection
- `🚫 Step 5: BLOCKING user` - Navigation blocking activated
- `⏰ Step 5: Starting countdown timer` - Timer started
- `📊 Step 6: Averages display complete` - Progression triggered

## Architecture Notes
- **Non-blocking processing**: Steps 3 & 4 run in background
- **User-friendly**: Timer can be skipped, maintains control
- **Robust**: Handles errors gracefully, auto-progression ensures flow continues
- **Visual feedback**: Beautiful UI transitions and celebrations
- **Complete flow**: From wine completion through next wine introduction

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
All 6 steps of the wine completion flow are now implemented and ready for testing.
