Your response should include:

1. **Red Wine Preferences**: Describe my preferences for red wines by highlighting specific qualities such as fruit flavors (e.g., berry, plum, spice), body (light, medium, full), acidity (low, balanced, high), tannins (soft, firm), and any notable regional influences. Use accessible language that resonates with my experience level, avoiding overly technical terminology.

2. **White Wine Preferences**: Summarize my tastes in white wines, focusing on aspects like fruit characteristics (e.g., citrus, stone fruit), texture (creamy, crisp), acidity (low, bright, refreshing), and any regional influences. Ensure the language is straightforward and relatable, making it easy for me to understand and share.

3. **Practical Questions for Wine Exploration**: Provide a list of practical, user-friendly questions I can ask at a wine shop or restaurant to discover wines that match my preferences. Focus on actionable queries that relate to specific qualities, grape varieties, and regional suggestions. For instance, instead of asking, "How do I find a Viognier that matches my taste for textured, bold whites?", you could suggest, "I recently enjoyed a Viognier. Can you recommend another white wine with a similar bold texture from a different region?" Make sure the questions are clear, relevant, and confidence-building.

Maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, empowering me to explore and inquire about wines that align with my tastes and preferences.
